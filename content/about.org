Congratulations! You are rare few who could reach here!

My social/formal name is Gaurav, a Software Engineer by profession and having all tendencies to be a Vedāntin (an expounder of [[/post/vedanta/][Vedānta]]).

Here, you will find my writings on Vedānta/Spirituality and GNU/Linux.

If you are into programming, this blog has been setup up with these:
- Static site generator: [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]
- Theme: [[https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even][Even]]
- Hosting: [[https://pages.github.com/][Github Pages]]
- Writing: [[https://orgmode.org/][Emacs org-mode]]

Hope you find the writings useful, and, wish you attain the eternal bliss of Super Conscious state!

Shivohum!
