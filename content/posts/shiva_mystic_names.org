** Shiva
Shiva means auspicious, pure. The eternal resupreme consciousness which empowers everything. Through His Shakti, creation happens and acquire different qualities: satvik, rajasik or tamasik or remain in different states: awake, dream or sleep. But, Shiva, the pure, is untouched by these qualities or states. He can’t be known as an object, so senses can’t perceive it. How can you know that is the knower itself? He can only be realized by dropping the individual ego and merging into Him.

** Swambhoo or Shambhu
Swambhoo means self-created. Shiva is the eternal and is the deity of ego. This world is a series of causes and effects. Shiva is the first cause and knowledge principle; self-created and self-sustained.
