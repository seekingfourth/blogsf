Once I was sitting with 3 years old in the balcony; pre-dawn, facing west. Soon we noticed sudden shift in light, and a short conversation triggered:

I: See that Sun has risen

She: Where is it?

I: You see the sunlight now and that's a sign that sun is there

She: Why can't I see it then?

I: We are facing in the opposite direction, and because of the buildings we can't see it. Once you get ready for school, we will go out and we can see the Sun then.

So is the world and the creator. We see the signs in every way: functioning of eating, speaking, motion of the planets. When we prepare ourselves and move in the right direction, we experience the source as well.

The sun light doesn't differentiate between good and evil. It is equally available to all. The choice is ours: whether we wish to prepare ourselves with a steady intellect and a heart full of love or a lunatic mind and a shrinked heart. Former will lead us to the source of ultimate truth, knowledge and bliss. The latter will leave us looping in reflections of light and darkness.

Taking the former path is our evolution. You may take your time, but are you not hasty for everything else?
