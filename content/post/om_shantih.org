*ॐ शांतिः शांतिः शांतिः ।। (Om! Peace! Peace! Peace!)*

Everybody wants peace, not for idleness but for activity too. Without peace, life would be at constant war externally and internally. It can't make any progressive development. However, it has become such a rare phenomenon that people have actually started considering it as an ultimate goal in life:

Peace is not the ultimate goal, but the most fundamental requirement in one’s life. Those who think that having peace of mind is the highest goal, will only rest in peace.

Daily study of the vedic scriptures starts and ends with peace invocation. It includes peace three times. Why so? These refer to three planes of existence where hurdles might come in spiritual practice. These are:

- ādhidaivika (आधिदैविक): Pertaining to Gods or supernatural. Things like earthquake, storm, rain etc.
- ādhibhautika (आधिभौतिक): Pertaining to other beings or natural. Things like war, animals etc.
- ādhyātmika (आध्यात्मिक): Pertaining to self or physical. Things like disease, unwillingness to study, lethargy, worldly desires etc.

It might be an invocation only for ādhidaivika hurdles, but, Peace is earned with efforts. There is no Spiritual practice possible without peace.
