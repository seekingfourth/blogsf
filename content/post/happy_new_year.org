You would be joyful today, wouldn’t you? Why not, it’s about to be new year! You will refresh yourself by loosen up your (bad) memories of past and will be more determined with the plans for new year. Fantastic!

The breeze of new year will keep you on your toes for some days or a month and then you will start losing the excitement. Sounds familiar? Happened in past as well? So, why does it happen? We like the newness of it and suddenly it becomes old, and, who is excited about old stuff: clothes, car, mobile, love…no?

Here, the idea of newness is external and so it disappears. Someone made the calendar years and enabled you to see the newness. Certainly, this triggers you to be joyful but as it is not from inside, it fades away. If you go a bit conscious about it, and see, it is just ‘another’ day. And, if you pay attention, everyday is, is it not?

An year is composed of several ‘new’ components. So, just fine tune yourself to listen to them. Every day, hour and, what to say, ‘moment’ is new but only if you are willing to pay attention to it. So, if you want, you may feel the same excitement, same freshness every moment of your life. For sure, we want it but our memory doesn’t allow it. It keeps dragging us in past and then in future, and we lose the focus on ‘NOW’.

May you be conscious about ‘now’ and be joyful in it! Your ‘now’, is not going to start somewhere, it is just now…and now…and now…

Oh, totally forgot, Happy New Year!
