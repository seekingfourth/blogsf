** Introduction
Vedﾄ］ta is combination of two words: =Veda= means Knowledge and =anta= means end. So, it means end of knowledge.

This is not pessimistic end of knowledge, it means a state where there is nothing more to be known.

Since the end portions of Vedas, talk and provide instructions to attain such state, they are also called Vedﾄ］ta.
